Day Ten // 30 days of React challenge // A Different POV with a "ToDo List" app tutorial

For this app I followed a tutorial, to gain an alternate POV to how ive been coding with React.js so far.

Follow me programming noob as I stumble my way through self-learning React.js. Each day for thirty days i'll be creating a simple app and posting about it, (attempting to) explain my code, and discuss what I have learned.

By the end of day 30 I hope to have a basic working knowledge of React.js and its applications!
