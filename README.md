**Day Ten - 30 days of React challenge - A Different POV with a "ToDo List" app tutorial**

Today is a little different. Instead of just figuring out how to build this myself, I followed a tutorial - to gain an alternate POV to how i've been coding with React.js so far. And to see how another developer approaches the problem.

**Concepts Explored:**
- Alternate ways of doing things
- Refs with React.createRef
- State vs Stateless components
- What is the virtual Dom, and what are lifecycle methods?
- Using a lifecycle method to focus your cursor

Follow me as I self-learn React.js. Each day for thirty days i'll be creating a simple app and posting about it, (attempting to) explain my code, and discuss what I have learned. By the end of day 30 I hope to have a basic working knowledge of React.js and its applications!
